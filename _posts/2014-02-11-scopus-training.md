## Metric for Journal and author evaluation
( Not in Scopus )  
* Impact factor
( In Scopus )  
* Source-Normaized Impact per Paper (SNIP
* Scimago Journal Rank (SJR)
* H-Index

## Why metrics?

Impact factor : total citations in 2011 from all items published in journal in 2009 and 2010 no. of only articles published in 2009 and 2010 = impact factor

## Subject field differences

Which journal is best?

* Nature material
* Cell
* Circulation
* Enterprise information systems
* etc

## SJR (available in 2009)

SCImago Journal Rank - SJR (Power of Prestige)

* developed by SCImago - Research Group, university of Granada

* Secondary feature: difference citation behaviour addressed
> * life science: high impact, lot of citations .. one citation = low value
> * art and humanities: Low impact, few of citations .. one citation = high value
* citations are weighted depending on the status of the source they come from
* share a journal's prestige equally ...

## SNIP (2009)

Source-normalized impact per paper - SNIP (balancing the scales)

* developed by Henk Moed, CWTS, University of Leiden
* Main feature: *contextual citation impact*
