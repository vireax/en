- *Research matters*: for newly awarded master students, not to be to proud of the pride because the journey was and can be really rough for everyone
- *Divergent thinking*: for those who never realize the importance of delayed gratification
- *Collaboration*: I fail too often to get people collaborate, report of my experience
- *Open access to government data*: it is possible to visualize national financial report to the public. As proof of transparency, the governement does not need to hide these data from taxpayers. Prior to getting the proposal accepted by the government, we need to prepare proof of concept, working prototype, and public opinion sufficiently.
- *Remarkable people*: my idols, and possibly, extra-ordinary stories of ordinary people
- *Reading*: to encourage regular reading practice in and outside classroom
- *Side effect of social networking*: I'm afraid to be social because being social is equal to being unproductive
- *Respect to parents*: ...
- *Cohabitation*: a little surprise at first steps to thailand
- *Cultural shock*: anything that shocks, depending on the reference, some people are not sensitive to the change
- *Politics x*: there should be something about politics here, it is difficult to praise politicians these day but it is even more difficult to criticize them
- *Vibration, sound, and light*: my view on side effect to research and social interaction
