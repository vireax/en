We become now too sick of hearing outnumbered problems of the state, organization, family, and personal thought. 

What if Internet becomes the most basic need of Maslow? People won't care too much about anything else. I'm just noticing the manipulation by politicians.

Wisdom hierarchy: data, information, knowledge, and wisdom.

I'm wondering what if we shift from political or military revolution to knowledge revolution where everyone have access to any information at will with transparency between all parties.
